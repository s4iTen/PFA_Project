            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              The Nikez Store project was born out of our shared love for
              sneakers and the desire to create a platform that empowers
              individuals to express their unique style. As a team, we believe
              that footwear is not just a necessity, but a form of
              self-expression and personal identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey began several months ago when we came together with a
              shared vision. We embarked on this project, investing countless
              hours into research, design, and development to bring the Nikez
              Store to life. We were inspired by the potential to revolutionize
              the way people customize and experience Nike shoes.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project is a testament to our passion for innovation and our
              commitment to providing users with a seamless and engaging
              experience. It is our way of contributing to the vibrant sneaker
              community and empowering individuals to define their style.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Nikez Store project is a Portfolio Project for Holberton
              School, and it represents the culmination of our hard work and
              dedication. You can find the project repository on GitHub:
